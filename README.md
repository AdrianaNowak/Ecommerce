# E-commerce application
E-commerce is an application with Node.js Web Server with some HTML pages, that's allow users to view items and shop, add them to a cart and attempt to purchase them. 
This website show a list of different items that users can purchase. For each item there are image, title and price. Underneatch each item we have a button that says "Add to Cart" and when user clicks that, they're going to add that item to shopping cart. 
User can click on cart link and go to a page where they will see their shopping cart with the different items that they have added. For each item, we show a title, a quantity, a price and total price. Users can remove items out of the shopping cart. 

App has also Admin Panels to have ability to take a look at all existing products, edit the existing ones to change they image, title and price and delete them. When administrator decide to create a new product or edit an existing one, we show a form in which we have a text input for the product name, the price, and the button to upload an image. 
For this actions we have sign up page for administrators with email, password, and password confirmation and the sing in page to log in after the sing up.
